## Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly updates on investigation progress
- **Resolution**: Target resolution within 30 days for high-severity issues

## Security Response Process

1. **Receipt & Acknowledgment**: We acknowledge receipt of your report
2. **Investigation**: Our security team investigates the reported vulnerability
3. **Validation**: We validate and reproduce the vulnerability
4. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix
5. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We coordinate with you on responsible disclosure
6. **Release**: We release the security update
7. **Public Disclosure**: We publish security advisory after fix is deployed

## Responsible Disclosure

- We will work with you to understand and validate the vulnerability
- We will keep you informed of our progress
- We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)
- We will coordinate public disclosure after the fix is available

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### API Security
- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for API communications
- **Secure API Keys**: Store API keys securely, never commit to version control
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect rate limits and implement proper retry logic
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs on the client side

#### Deployment Security
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls and authentication
- **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies and components updated
- **Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual activity and potential attacks

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize all user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries
- **XSS Prevention**: Escape output and use Content Security Policy
- **Authentication**: Implement secure authentication mechanisms
- **Authorization**: Follow principle of least privilege

#### Dependencies
- **Regular Audits**: Run `pip-audit` and similar tools regularly
- **Version Pinning**: Pin dependency versions in production
- **Security Updates**: Apply security updates promptly
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrate security scanning in CI/CD

## Known Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- **User Data**: We collect minimal user data necessary for functionality
- **Text Processing**: Texts sent to WIBA API are processed and may be logged
- **Retention**: We retain data only as long as necessary
- **Compliance**: We follow applicable data protection regulations

### API Security
- **Authentication**: All API endpoints require valid authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: APIs are rate-limited to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated before processing
- **Error Handling**: Error messages don't expose sensitive information

### Model Security
- **Model Integrity**: Models are validated before deployment
- **Adversarial Inputs**: Models are tested against adversarial examples
- **Bias Testing**: Models are evaluated for potential biases
- **Output Validation**: Model outputs are validated before returning

## Security Tools and Processes

### Automated Security Scanning

We use the following automated security tools:

- **pip-audit**: Python dependency vulnerability scanning
- **TruffleHog**: Secret detection in code repositories
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis security testing
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing in CI/CD

### Manual Security Reviews

- **Code Reviews**: All code changes undergo security-focused reviews
- **Architecture Reviews**: Security architecture reviews for major changes
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular penetration testing of production systems
- **Third-party Audits**: Periodic third-party security assessments

## Security Updates

### Notification Channels

Stay informed about security updates:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Watch repositories for security advisories
- **Release Notes**: Security fixes are documented in release notes
- **Email Notifications**: Critical security updates may be emailed to users

### Update Process

When security updates are available:

1. **Review Advisory**: Read the security advisory for impact assessment
2. **Plan Update**: Plan the update for your deployment
3. **Test Update**: Test the update in a non-production environment
4. **Deploy Update**: Deploy the security update to production
5. **Verify Fix**: Verify that the security fix is working correctly

## Security FAQ

### Q: How do you handle false positives in security reports?
A: We investigate all reports thoroughly. Even if a report turns out to be a false positive, we appreciate the effort and will respond respectfully.

### Q: Do you offer bug bounties?
A: Currently, we don't have a formal bug bounty program, but we greatly appreciate security researchers who help improve our security.

### Q: Can I test for vulnerabilities in WIBA systems?
A: Please contact us before conducting any security testing. Unauthorized testing may violate terms of service.

### Q: How do you ensure the security of ML models?
A: We validate model integrity, test against adversarial inputs, and regularly update models with security considerations.

### Q: What happens if I accidentally commit sensitive data?
A: Contact us immediately at airan002@ucr.edu. We can help with remediation and ensure the sensitive data is properly removed from Git history.
